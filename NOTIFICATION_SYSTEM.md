## Usage Examples

### Sending a Payment Reminder
```php

$user = User::find(1);
$paymentData = [
    'amount' => 15000000,
    'due_date' => '2024-01-25',
    'fee_type' => 'Tuition Fee'
];

$notification = $notificationService->sendPaymentReminder($user, $paymentData);
```

### Processing Scheduled Notifications
```bash
# Can be run as a scheduled job
php artisan tinker
>>> app(NotificationService::class)->processScheduledNotifications();
```

```

This notification system provides a solid foundation for the STEFIA application's communication needs and can be easily extended to meet additional requirements as the system grows.
